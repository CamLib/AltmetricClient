Computed tomographic (CT) data were imported into ProPlan CMF 1.4 software. The borders of the lesion and the inferior alveolar canal were marked, and a digital template designed to mark the borders, outline the canal, and guide the osteotomy. A mirror image of the unaffected mandible was used to make a stereolithographic model by a rapid prototyping technique to prefabricate the reconstruction plate for the bone graft. The accuracy of the designs and the templates was evaluated during operation and postoperatively by CT. The sensation of the skin was tested using a NeurometerÂ® CPT (current perception threshold) sensory detector (Neurotron Inc, Baltimore USA) to evaluate the function of the preserved inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle during follow up. With the digital template it was possible to guide removal of the bony lesion while accurately protecting the neurovascular bundle. Follow up for a mean of 8 months (range 5 -12) showed good facial symmetry, a stable occlusion, and recovery of sensation in the lower lip on the affected side. We conclude that a digital template can successfully help the resection of benign lesions of the mandible while preserving the function of the inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f25","authors":["Huang, Dong","Chen, MinJie","He, DongMei","Yang, Chi","Yuan, JianBing","Bai, Guo","Wang, YiWen","Wei, WenBin","Chen, ZhuoZhi"],"doi":"10.1016/j.bjoms.2015.04.013","first_seen_on":"2015-05-20T12:02:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-1940"],"journal":"British Journal of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1431519718,"links":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25962995"],"pmid":"25962995","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Preservation of the inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle in the osteotomy of benign lesions of the mandible using a digital template.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/preservation-inferior-alveolar-neurovascular-bundle-osteotomy-benign-lesions-mandible-using-digital"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5094594,"mean":6.0370985215128,"rank":4237724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5094594,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170528,"mean":9.0243029315007,"rank":140763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170528,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":338,"mean":1.3820356083086,"rank":258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":338,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.98125,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
